The below pricing is based on Tranasana's online listed price. Transana's purchase cost is also negotiable for large projects. Each multi-user license is per project and cannot be used on multiple projects. The multi-user license requires a server to operate. For this reason, in FEMA purchased Transana it would almost certainly require a negotiated long-term organization-wide pricing scheme. Organizations can either use their own server, or purchase a separate cloud server environment from Transana directly.
